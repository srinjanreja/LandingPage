BMW Landing Page

After a long time, represent my first Reponsie Website ðŸš€ðŸŽŠ. 

I enjoyed making this, and loved the process actually.

I actually made this website to understand some CSS concepts, 
like Flexbox , Grid, Transition, Pseudoclasses, Nav Bar etc.

Now I will try some backend projects, Starting with basic fundamentals, it is only the beginning ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥.

Wish me Luck :)

Thanks For Visiting My Repo.
